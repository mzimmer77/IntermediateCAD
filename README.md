## 4.1_CAD

### Description
the project is to work with our partner to create a ring and spinner. I was partner B so I made the spinner

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Reflection
Working with a partner can be hard because you need to stay in the same spots but I remembered cad and after asking for help I finished very fast.



## 4.2_CAD

### Description 
This assignment I had to make the prop that fit on the spinner.

### Reflection
it was a lot more challenging to use the half revolves and linear patterns because it was very intracate but my partner helped me.


##  4.3_CAD

### Description 
We had to finish the design and combine both pieces to create the final thing.

### Evidence

### Reflection
I got to use the animate tool after putting everything in the assembly.

## 4.4/5_CAD

### Description & Code
We had to make different branches to create different versions.


### Evidence

### Reflection
I learned that branches can be helpful when making changes to parts



## Swing_Arm

### Description 
We had to use a set of detailed drawings to create a sketch and a part




### Evidence

### Reflection
I had trouble with this assignment because of the different angles and the many constrants tripped me up.




## Multi-Part Studio

### Description 
We had to use a set of detailed drawings to create multiple parts and add them all together.

### Reflection
Using the revolve tool is helpful for making the top, do not fillet it because you need to do it on the inside.

### Reflection
The onshape certification test takes a LOT of time to prepare for. Making sure you do all of the practice assignments is key. Additonally knowing what you can and can't do on the test helps. for the multiple choice section of the test you should remember that it is open internet so you can use other reasources such as google or the onshape website. For me, I did prepare for the test with the practice assignments but I didn't take them that seriously and so I didn't pass my first time. One of the reasons for why that happened was due to my answers snowballing. for example, if I got the first answer wrong on the swing arm all of the next aanswers would either be a little off or completely wrong which seriously messes you up. If you do fail the first time remember that the second time you take it (it is worth it) the questions are exactly the same as the first time and yu will be a lotmore ready the second time.
