### Description
the project is to work with our partner to create a ring and spinner. I was partner B so I made the spinner

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Reflection
Working with a partner can be hard because you need to stay in the same spots but I remembered cad and after asking for help I finished very fast.



## 4.2_CAD

### Description 
This assignment I had to make the prop that fit on the spinner.


### Evidence

### Reflection
it was a lot more challenging to use the half revolves and linear patterns because it was very intracate but my partner helped me.


##  4.3_CAD

### Description 
We had to finish the design and combine both pieces to create the final thing.

### Evidence

### Reflection
I got to use the animate tool after putting everything in the assembly.

## 4.4/5_CAD

### Reflection
I learned that branches can be helpful when making changes to parts



## Swing_Arm

We had to use a set of detailed drawings to create a sketch and a part




### Evidence

### Reflection
I had trouble with this assignment because of the different angles and the many constrants tripped me up.




## Multi-Part Studio

### Description 
We had to use a set of detailed drawings to create multiple parts and add them all together.

### Reflection
Using the revolve tool is helpful for making the top, do not fillet it because you need to do it on the inside.
